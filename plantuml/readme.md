# PlantUML
This UML refactoring exercise is aimed at less technical people like analysts, testers and other non-programmers. The key takeaway message is clarifying the need for continuous refactoring to people who do not code on a daily basis.

## Running and rendering
Several alternatives are available to render PlantUML, see https://plantuml.com/running.

# Exercise
You can find the original GildedRose challenge in the gilded-rose.puml file.

If you want to illustrate how this activity diagram got to this state, you can show the requirements and the files under the /history directory. These individual files show the evolution of the activity diagram.
